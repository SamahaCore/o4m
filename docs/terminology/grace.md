# Grace Period

A Grace period is a 6-month period that begins after you graduate or leave school. During this period, you are not expected to start repaying your loan. However, what many students don’t know is that during this period, interest starts to accumulate ([check "Pay back OSAP"](https://www.ontario.ca/page/pay-back-osap)). Earlier, we mentioned to take note that the Ontario (provincial) and Canada (federal) components of the loans are independent, and this is why: during the grace period, interest is not charged ([check "Non-repayment Period"](https://www.csnpe-nslsc.canada.ca/en/stages-of-a-loan)) on the federal portion of your loan, but it is charged on the provincial portion.* After the 6-month grace period, interest will accumulate on both components of the loan.

::: tip Note
After the [changes made by the provincial government](https://news.ontario.ca/maesd/en/2019/01/affordability-of-postsecondary-education-in-ontario.html), interest will be charged on the provincial portion of the loan during the grace period instead of the federal portion. Prior to September 1, 2019 interest would accrue on the federal portion but not the provincial portion.

## Forgiven Interest
If you return to school as a full-time student within the 6-month grace period the accrued interest will be forgiven. Many students think of the grace period as a six-month "interest-free" period that begins after graduation. This is not entirely accurate. Post secondary students taking OSAP actually go through a grace period every year without even knowing about it. Each year, a grace period is initiated on the last day of your last OSAP-funded term. For most students, this is usually the end of April when the Winter semester finishes. So, unless you are taking spring/summer courses, interest accumulates during your summer break even if you plan to return to school for the fall semester. However, when you actually return to school in September, the interest gets cleared. This is because the spring/summer term is only 4 months, which is less than the maximum grace period of 6 months. By returning to school in September, you return to the In-Study category.

It is only if you decide to **not** return to school for the fall semester that the interest will not be forgiven and it will be added on to your outstanding loan. This is the case regardless of which term you are not in school. For example, if you take the winter semester off (4 months) but return in the spring/summer semester as a full-time student, the accrued interest will drop. However, if you take the winter semester AND the spring/summer semester off (8 months) the accrued interest will remain and you will even be required to start repaying your loans (and the accrued interest) after the 6-month mark. The only exception to the 6-month maximum is if you are registered in an approved co-op placement.

The following organizations, which may fall within the above definition, are excluded for the purposes of this program:
