If you are in a registered Co-op program, apply for a 12-16 month internship or dedicate a whole year for 3-4 different 4 month Co-ops (this gives you more diversified experience).

One “hack” is to delay your graduation date and work more Co-op terms. While graduating later may be distasteful to some, on practical terms no full-time employer really cares how long it took you to complete your program. Also you will get the added benefit of having more experience and skills on your resume when you’re applying to full-time jobs. Several students have delayed their graduation date to work extra Co-op terms. This has helped them generate the extra income needed to graduate debt free.\nA bonus tip is to find a Co-op/internship in the U.S. This has several benefits. The first is that you’ll be earning in USD. Thus when you transfer funds to your Canadian Bank account, you’ll actually have made 30% more (depending on the exchange rate). For example, if you earned $10,000 over the course of a 4 month internship in the US, when you transfer that money to your account in Canada, it will result in $13,000. Secondly, several top employers, especially those in Silicon Valley, give their students a stipend for rent. Since rent is usually the largest living expense, this means you will have more net income you can use to pay off your loans and graduate debt free. If working in the U.S or at top employers seems unattainable you should know that students who managed to work at these places started with the zero work experience in first year. Experience and opportunities are built through projects, volunteering, research, networking and more.

If you have made it this far without taking any loans, you are indeed very successful today, and have an incredible head start in life.\nIf you required OSAP loans to pay your tuition and other fees, you should arrange to pay it all off before or while finishing up your final exams to avoid any interest charges. Remember that the term finishes at the end of the month; be diligent so as not to pay a single day’s worth of interest. This will only be possible if you took the necessary steps to work hard before and during University to make enough money to pay off your loan. If you manage to pay off your OSAP loan before finishing your finals with your own hard-earned money, congratulations, you are also ahead of the game.\nIf you are unable to fully pay off your loan by the end of your exams, you still may have some hope. Try to get interest-free loans to pay off the OSAP loan. Make a solid career and repayment plan and take it to any family/friends that may be willing to loan you cash. You can ask multiple people to help with small amounts. Make sure to provide a concrete plan and timeline to repay their loan. Hopefully, you can gather enough money to pay off all of your OSAP loan before graduation. Keep an accurate record of how much you owe people and when and where you returned some or all of their money. Remember that these are your closest relationships, and wrongdoings involving money can jeopardize or irreparably harm your relationships. So do everything in your power to pay these loans off as soon as possible. Do not go and buy an expensive car with your first check if you still owe people money! Debts and the preservation of your ties of kinship should be your first priority as soon as your start making money. If friends/family is not an option for you, look into organizations that provide interest free loans (Beneficent, Iana Financial).\nIf you are absolutely unable to gather enough funds to pay off your OSAP loan, you have no choice but to go through the traditional method of paying it off yourself over time while accruing interest. Your first priority should be paying off this student loan as soon as possible. This means finding any source of halal-income right away, even if it’s not your dream job. A budget should be made to put as much of your income as possible towards paying off the loan. The earlier you pay off the loan, the less interest you need to pay. It will be very difficult, but you will be very happy you did it when you’re debt free. If we find ourselves in this situation, we should repent for indulging in the paying of interest and make a sincere intention to never put ourselves in such an interest-bearing situation again. Indeed, Allah is the most merciful, so ask for His forgiveness and protection from dealing with interest.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);o.default=n.exports}}]);
