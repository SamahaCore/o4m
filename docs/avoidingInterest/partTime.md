# Switching to Part-Time

If you are switching from full time studies to part time studies then you will have to apply for interest free status to avoid interest charges to your full time studies loan. For continuation of interest-free status during your part-time studies, you will have to fill out the [schedule-2](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/education/student-aid/grants-loans/information/forms.html) form to confirm your enrolment in part-time studies.

::: tip Note
Interest will accrue on your account every month of part-time studies. However, it will be removed from your account at the end of each month as long as you are still enrolled in part-time studies. Call [NSLSC](https://protege-secure-2.csnpe-nslsc.canada.ca/eng/ContactUs.aspx) for more information.
