# Taking a Break

If you take an extended break (six months or more) during your studies, you will lose your In Study status at the start of your break and your Non Repayment status will expire six months into your break. To avoid interest, you must pay back your loan during full-time studies before starting your extended break.

::: tip Note
Refer to this [section](/repayment/payOff.md) to learn about the minimum payment required to avoid interest during the grace period (Non Repayment status).
