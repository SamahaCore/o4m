# Internships

If the internship is six months or longer and not recognized by your post secondary institute as a part of your degree/diploma then it is treated the same as an extended break. Meet with an academic advisor and financial aid advisor at your institute to discuss the eligibility for interest free status during your internship. If your internship is not eligible then you must pay back your loan during full time studies to avoid interest. 

::: tip Note
Refer to this [section](/repayment/payOff.md) to learn about the minimum payment required to avoid interest during the grace period (Non Repayment status).
