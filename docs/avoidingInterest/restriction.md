# Academic Restriction

If you are continuing full time studies (60% course load) during OSAP restriction period then you must apply for interest free status to avoid interest charges. If you do not apply for interest free status or discontinue full time studies, interest will begin accruing right after your last semester of your full time studies. To avoid interest, you must pay back your loan during full-time studies.

::: tip Note
Refer to this [section](/repayment/payOff.md) to learn about the minimum payment required to avoid interest during the grace period (Non Repayment status).
