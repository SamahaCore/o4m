# Pay off interest-accruing portion <Badge text="New" type="warning"/>
It’s been brought to our attention by members of the community and corroborated by our own team that it’s possible to pay off just the provincial (interest-accruing) portion of the loan in lump sum. The amount is usually much smaller than the federal portion so this is a huge benefit for those who would like to avoid interest.

To check the amount, log into your NSLSC account. Once you’re on your dashboard, under “Funding Summary”, click the link to your loan. You should see a breakdown of your loan with the interest rates.

How to pay off provincial portion in lump sum:
1. Obtain a bank draft totalling the full provincial loan amount and make it out to the National Student Loans Service Centre (NSLSC). In the “RE” line put your student loan number. (can be found in the same “Funding Summary” page)
2. Write a letter in the format below and mail it to NSLSC’s office in Mississauga. Their address can be found on the “Contact Us” section of their website.

**Letter Format**

*NSLSC full address*

*Memorandum to: National Student Loans Service Centre (NSLSC)*

*Subject: What the bank draft is for and your student loan number*

*Letter body: Explain that you have authorized the NSLSC to use the attached bank draft to pay off just the provincial portion of your student loan (include your loan number and the amount).*

*Sign off: Your full name typed and a line for your signature and date.*
