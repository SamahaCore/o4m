            <p>The Ontario Student Assistant Program funds students needing financial assistance for their post secondary education. The funding is made up of 3 parts: two of which are grants that do not need to be repaid and one of which is a loan that will need to be repaid at a later date. The grants include: The <strong>Ontario student grant</strong> and The <strong>Canada student grant for full time students</strong>, whereas the loan is composed of <strong>Canada - Ontario integrated student loan</strong>.</p>
            <p>It is important to keep in mind that the loan portion is an integrated provincial and federal loan. They are two different portions of the loan, each with its own properties. Later we will discuss how different rules apply to both of them separately.</p>
            <p><strong>Grants</strong> are essentially free money provided by the government to reduce the overall loans on students. Students do not need to repay that. <strong>Loans</strong> are NOT FREE money. All loans will need to be paid off at an eventual date.</p>
            <p><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> Use extra grants/ scholarships/ bursaries that are left after education expenses to pay off loans as soon as possible</p>
            <p>During the life of a student, they are put within three categories depending on their current status.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The <strong><em>In-Study</em></strong> category is defined as when a student is currently in school pursuing education. In this stage, students <strong>are not required to make any payments and DO NOT accumulate any interest</strong> on any outstanding loans, provided enrollment is confirmed every year.</li>
              <li>The <strong><em>Non-Repayment</em></strong> category is known as a “grace period” and occurs when the student is no longer within the <em>In-Study</em> period, lasting 6 months after <em>In-Study</em> status ends. In this stage, the student <strong>does not need to make any payments</strong> towards outstanding loans, however, they <strong>begin to accumulate interest</strong> on those loans. More details of this phase are discussed below.</li>
              <li>The <strong><em>Repayment</em></strong> category is when the <em>Non-Repayment</em> stage ends, and students are mandated to begin paying off their loans.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4 id="second">Grace period: What is it?</h4>
            <p>The <strong>Grace period</strong> is a 6 month period after you graduate or leave school in which you are not required to make payments however <strong><a href="https://www.csnpe-nslsc.canada.ca/en/glossary" target="_blank">interest starts to accumulate</a></strong>. Earlier we mentioned to take note that the Ontario and Canada portion of the loans are separate and this is why: During the grace period interest is <strong><em>not</em></strong> charged on the provincial portion but it <strong><em>is</em></strong> charged on the federal portion.* And after the 6 months interest will accumulate for <strong>both</strong> portions of the loan.</p>
            <p>*<strong>Note:</strong> This was the case if you graduated or left school prior to September 1, 2019. After the <a href="https://news.ontario.ca/maesd/en/2019/01/affordability-of-postsecondary-education-in-ontario.html" target="_blank">changes made by the provincial government</a>, interest will be charged on the Ontario portion of the loan during the grace period as well as the federal portion.</p>
            
            <h4>Grace period: Forgiven Interest</h4>
            <p>The grace period starts at the end of the last month of your osap funded term for that specific year, <strong>NOT</strong> when you graduate or end your studies. This is usually the end of April for most students when they finish their Winter semester (Jan - Apr). So every summer during your studies if you are not taking any Spring/Summer courses, interest starts to accumulate, even if you are planning to return to school in the Fall. However, since you plan to return to school to continue your studies the <strong>interest is cleared</strong>. This is because the Spring/Summer term is only 4 months, which is less than the maximum grace period of 6 months, and your status is returned to In-Study in September. It is only if you do not decide to return to school to continue your studies in the fall, the interest will not be forgiven and added on to your outstanding loan. This is the case regardless of the specific term one is not in school. If you take the winter semester off (4 months), but return in the Spring/Summer as full time, they same rule applies to you. However, if you take the Winter semester and the Spring/Summer semester off (8 months) without being registered in an approved co-op and return in the fall, you will have accrued interest and would even need to begin paying off your loans after the 6 month mark.</p>
            <p>In short, if you return to school as a fulltime student within the grace period (6 months) the interest accrued will be forgiven.</p>
            
            <h4>How to qualify for interest free status:</h4>
            <p>Once you take OSAP for full-time studies you have to remain in full-time studies or an approved internship in order to qualify for the interest-free status. Meaning you will not have to make any payments and interest does not accrue. This is because regardless if you are enrolled in school, or in an approved internship you are considered in the In-Study category. If at any time you wish to either switch into part-time studies (take less than 60% of the course load per term) or take a period of time off from school for greater than 6 months <strong>interest will start to accumulate.</strong><br><br><strong>Note:</strong> Generally most universities allow engineering students to go on a longer term internship (more than 4 months) while being eligible for continuation of interest free status because they deem it a necessary part of the degree (given you register and get the internship approved by them). So unless your program, and more specifically your university has allowed some sort of form or policy to get that status for a non engineering program you will most likely not be able to continue your interest free status, even if your program name has “coop” in it. Ask your financial aid advisor about being eligible for interest free status before accepting any long term internships.</p>

            <h4>Minimum Course Requirements</h4>
            <p>You must complete and pass 60% of your course load during <strong>each term</strong>* of your academic year otherwise you will be put on academic probation by osap. Which is essentially a warning for you to make sure you pass the required amount of courses in the following year. If you fail to pass 60% of the courses the following year as well then you will be put on academic restriction by osap which means no funding for you for one year. During that year you will have to pay out of pocket for your courses while making sure to pass the required amount of courses. If you succeed then you can apply to osap once again after you do the 1 year time. You will have to submit documentation as to why you did not perform as expected during both the years you failed to pass the required amount of courses.</p>
            <p>*<strong>Note:</strong> Course load percentages work differently in the spring/summer term. Be very careful when enrolling or dropping courses during that time, especially if you are unsure about your circumstances, because in some cases dropping even 1 course will switch your status from fulltime to part-time. Be sure to talk to your financial aid advisor.</p>

            <h4>Penalties</h4>
            <p>There are a few <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/after-you-apply-osap" target="_blank">cases</a> in which your grants are converted into loans.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>you withdraw from studies or stop taking the minimum course load within the first 30 days of starting school</li>
              <li>at the end of the study period, as a result of an OSAP reassessment, you’re not entitled to all or part of the grant that you received (e.g., dropped courses, unreported income)</li>
              <li>the income reported in connection to your application can’t be verified within one year from the start of your studies (Ontario Student Grant only)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Continuation of studies but not taking OSAP?</h4>       
            <p>If you’re continuing full time or part time studies, but don’t plan on applying for OSAP in the upcoming year and have an outstanding loan balance, you can apply for continuation of interest free status in order to not have any interest accrued on your previous loans. Simply apply for interest-free status on OSAP’s website. For more info click <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/after-you-apply-osap" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <h4>Repayment Assistance Plan</h4>
            <p>If you are at the end of your studies and you don’t have enough money to pay off your loans or do not want to extend your degree/ continue your education there may still be a way to avoid interest. The government can cover some or all interest depending on household size and gross income; also disabilities/special cases.

            <h3 id="third"><u>How to pay off OSAP</u></h3><br>
            <!--<p class="blog-post-meta">December 23, 2013 by <a href="#">Jacob</a></p>-->

            <p>In theory, paying off debts is very simple, but in reality it is very difficult for most people. Just search current consumer and student debt numbers to see what we mean. Here are some practical ways which you can use to pay off your student debt.</p>

            <p>Firstly, do not have a need to apply for the OSAP loan at all. What does this mean? Start saving early! For some, they are fortunate enough to have an education savings plan, usually started by their parent/guardian. By the time they reach their post-secondary education, they have enough to pay for their education without even taking any grants/scholarships. If you are among these, consider yourself very fortunate and make the most of this blessing. Many of us, however, do not have education savings that can fully or even partially cover our expenses. Fortunately, there are still things we can do!</p>
            
            <h6><em><u>Before post secondary education</u></em></h6>
            <h4>Start working and saving early!</h4>
            <p>Many teenagers pick up part time work during high-school. Make a decent resume and apply to your local businesses, ask your network of adults if they can help you get a job, and be creative. Don’t like working a part-time job, make your own side business to run after school and on the weekends. You can turn a hobby or interest of yours into money. Don’t have any ideas? Google side business ideas for teens. Pick something you’ll like and stick to it, whether it's a job or business, just start working! Make a budget to start saving a portion of your earnings towards your post-secondary education. Look into halal investment options where you can let your education fund grow over time.</p>

            <h4>Begin looking into scholarships</h4>
            <p>There are millions of dollars of unclaimed scholarships every year. Make a system where you can slowly, but consistently apply to as many scholarships as you can. Research online the best resources and techniques to help you with your applications. It’s going to be tough work, but the rewards are great! Imagine getting hundreds of dollars free by only putting in 1 hour of work every day! Don’t be lazy like most people, take action!</p>

            <h6><em><u>During post secondary education</u></em></h6>
            <h4>Apply for OSAP Grants only</h4>
            <p>You can still apply for OSAP grants without taking any loans. Always make sure to apply for the grant portion of OSAP. This is money to fund your education that does not need to be paid back! Try to avoid taking the loan if you can.</p>

            <h4>Keep applying to scholarships</h4>
            <p>Many students stop this step once they are accepted and are missing out on potentially thousands of dollars. Apply for <strong>bursaries and other grants</strong>. Research what grants and bursaries your school offers. Always apply! The worst case is that you would have spent some time in the application, the best case is that you’ll get a lot of money to pay for your education. Remember to keep consistent in your applications. Spending just 1 hour everyday on this can really go a long way!</p>

            <h4>Work part-time during school and in the summers</h4>
            <p>This may not be a viable option for everyone, especially if you have a large study load. However, many students do manage to pull this off and scrape in some extra-income to help pay off their expenses. Many schools have work-study programs where they offer jobs on and around campus for students looking to work while they study. Make sure to make the most of your summers. Start applying to summer jobs a few months before the summer begins. Not only does this make you money, but also gives you valuable experience to get a head-start on your career after graduation.</p>

            <h4>Do Co-op!</h4>
            <p>If you are in a registered Co-op program, make use of your school job board and research company websites to find summer postings. Co-op jobs traditionally pay higher than regular summer jobs and usually provide you with more experience related to your field. Take a year off for an approved internship. If you are in a registered Co-op program, apply for a 12-16 month internship, or dedicate a whole year for 3-4 different 4 month Co-ops (this gives you more diversified experience). This step is highly recommended, especially if you are in a professional degree (engineering, business etc.) so that you can make a good sum of money to pay your expenses and enter into your career after graduation with a year of professional experience, giving you a great advantage over your peers who did not gain this experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important not to put all your trust in the ability to get a long term internship so you can make enough money to pay off your loans. Make backup plans in case you are unable to find an internship.</p>

            <h6><em><u>At the end of post secondary education and beyond</u></em></h6>
            <p>Congratulations! At this point you have reached the end of your formal education. If you’ve made it this far without taking any loans, you are indeed very successful today, and have a massive head start in your adult life.</p>
            <p>If you had to take OSAP loans to pay your tuition and other fees, at this point you should pay it all off <strong>before or during</strong> finishing your final exams to avoid any interest charges. Remember the term ends at the end of the month so be diligent so that you do not pay a single day’s worth of interest. This will only be possible if you took the necessary due diligence steps to work hard before and during University to make enough money to pay off your loan. If you manage to pay off your OSAP loan before finishing your finals with your own hard-earned money, congratulations, you are also God willing, successful.</p>
            <p>If your at a point where you are unable to fully pay off your loan at the end of your exams, you still may have some hope. Try to get interest-free loans to pay off the OSAP loan. Make a solid career and repayment plan and take it to any family/friends that may be willing to loan you cash. You can ask multiple people to help with small numbers and give them a concrete plan and timeline to repay their loan. Hopefully, you can gather enough money to pay off all of your OSAP loan before graduation. Keep an accurate record of how much you owe people and when and where you returned some or all of their money. Remember that these are your closest relationships, and money can sometimes turn relationships bad, so do everything in your power to pay these loans off as soon as possible after graduation. Do not go and buy an expensive car with your first check if you still owe people money! Debts and the preservation of your ties of kinship should be your first priority as soon as your start making money. If friends/family is not an option for you, look into organizations that provide interest free loans (<a href="https://beneficent.cc/" target="_blank">Beneficent</a>).</p>
            <p>In the final case that you are completely unable to gather enough funds to pay off your OSAP loan, you have no choice but to go through the traditional option of paying it yourself over time and accruing interest. Your first priority should be paying off this student loan as soon as possible. This means finding any source of halal-income right away, even if it’s not your dream job. A budget should be made to put as much income possible towards paying off the loan. The earlier you pay off the loan, the less interest you need to pay. It will be very difficult, but you will be very happy you did it after you’re debt free. If we find ourselves in this situation, we should repent for indulging in the paying of interest and make a sincere intention to never put ourselves in such an interest-bearing situation again. Indeed, Allah is the most merciful, so ask for his forgiveness and protection from dealing with interest. </p>
            <p>Note: If you were unable to find any interest free loan options then there are other avenues to get loans at a much lower interest rate. Use the lower interest rate loan to pay off your student debts to potentially save money.</p>

            <h3 id="fourth">FAQ</h3><br>
            <!--<p class="blog-post-meta">December 14, 2013 by <a href="#">Chris</a></p>-->

            <ol>
              <li>I just finished my 2nd year in a business program. I am not taking any summer courses and I received an offer for a 4 month coop in the fall term of the upcoming year. Will I still have interest free status?<br><br>Ans: Since you are not taking any summer courses your last official date as a fulltime student would be the end of April. And the interest accrued after your last day as a fulltime student is only wiped if you return to school as a full time student within 6 months. If you accept your coop offer and not take a minimum of 60% of your course load during your coop then you won’t be considered as a fulltime student until the end of the fall term (December). Since the break between April and December is greater than 6 months the interest you accumulated on your loan will not be reversed. A potential solution to this would be to take summer courses and get that full time student status, then the gap between your last day out of school changes to end of august and if you return to school in january then that is within the 6 month period and your interest will be wiped.<br><br>Note: after the 6 month period you will also start to receive calls asking you to start repayment.</li><br>
              <li>I am in an engineering program and I want to do an extra 8 month coop starting in the winter term however I do not want to inform my university because I will have to pay the coop fee. Would my osap loans still be interest free?<br><br>Ans: If you don’t inform your university then they can’t inform the financial aid office who in turn won’t be able to confirm that you’re still a student for OSAP purposes. So in their eyes you’re leaving school or graduating. So unless you decide to somehow become a fulltime student again within 6 months (take 60% course load in the summer term; May-Aug) you will accrue interest and will be asked to make payments after the 6 months. Since you are in the engineering program you may be eligible for continuation of interest free status on coop (your grace period doesn’t start) depending on your university. If that is the case we strongly recommend paying that extra coop fee because it will allow you to work in peace without having to worry about interest accumulating.</li>
