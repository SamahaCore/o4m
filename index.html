            <!--<p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2014 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p>-->

            <p>The Ontario Student Assistant Program funds students needing financial assistance for their post secondary education. The funding is made up of 3 parts: two of which are grants that do not need to be repaid and one of which is a loan that will need to be repaid at a later date. The grants include: The <strong>Ontario student grant</strong> and The <strong>Canada student grant for full time students</strong>, whereas the loan is composed of <strong>Canada - Ontario integrated student loan</strong>.</p>
            <p>It is important to keep in mind that the loan portion is an integrated provincial and federal loan. They are two different portions of the loan, each with its own properties. Later we will discuss how different rules apply to both of them separately.</p>
            <p><strong>Grants</strong> are essentially free money provided by the government to reduce the overall loans on students. Students do not need to repay that. <strong>Loans</strong> are NOT FREE money. All loans will need to be paid off at an eventual date.</p>
            <p><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> Use extra grants/ scholarships/ bursaries that are left after education expenses to pay off loans as soon as possible</p>
            <p>During the life of a student, they are put within three categories depending on their current status.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The <strong><em>In-Study</em></strong> category is defined as when a student is currently in school pursuing education. In this stage, students <strong>are not required to make any payments and DO NOT accumulate any interest</strong> on any outstanding loans, provided enrollment is confirmed every year.</li>
              <li>The <strong><em>Non-Repayment</em></strong> category is known as a “grace period” and occurs when the student is no longer within the <em>In-Study</em> period, lasting 6 months after <em>In-Study</em> status ends. In this stage, the student <strong>does not need to make any payments</strong> towards outstanding loans, however, they <strong>begin to accumulate interest</strong> on those loans. More details of this phase are discussed below.</li>
              <li>The <strong><em>Repayment</em></strong> category is when the <em>Non-Repayment</em> stage ends, and students are mandated to begin paying off their loans.</li>
            </ol>
            <!--<hr>

            <h2 id="first">Things to know before applying</h2>
            <p><strong>Grace period:</strong> a 6 month period after you graduate or leave school in which you are not required to make payments however <strong>interest starts to accumulate</strong>. Earlier we mentioned to take note that the Ontario and Canada portion of the loans are separate and this is the reason why. Interest is <strong><em>not</em></strong> charged on the provincial portion but it <strong><em>is</em></strong> charged on the federal portion.* And after the 6 months interest will accumulate for <strong>both</strong> portions of the loan.</p>
            <p><strong>*Note:</strong> This was the case if you graduated or left school prior to September 1, 2019. After the changes made by the provincial government, interest will be charged on the Ontario portion of the loan during the grace period as well as the federal portion.</p>
            
            <h3>How to qualify for interest free status:</h3>
            <p>Once you take OSAP for full-time studies you have to remain in full-time studies or an approved internship in order to qualify for the interest-free status. Meaning you will not have to make any payments and interest does not accrue. This is because regardless if you are enrolled in school, or in an approved internship you are considered in the In-Study category. If at any time you wish to either switch into part-time studies (take less than 60% of the course load per term) or take a period of time off from school for greater than 6 months <strong>interest will start to accumulate.</strong><br><strong>Note:</strong>Generally most universities allow engineering students to go on a longer term internship (more than 4 months) while being eligible for continuation of interest free status because they deem it a necessary part of the degree (given you register and get the internship approved by them). So unless your program, and more specifically your university has allowed some sort of form or policy to get that status for a non engineering program you will most likely not be able to continue your interest free status, even if your program name has “coop” in it. Ask your financial aid advisor about being eligible for interest free status before accepting any long term internships.</p>

            <h3>Gace period: Forgiven Interest</h3>
            <p>The grace period starts at the end of the last month of your osap funded term for that specific year, <strong>NOT</strong> when you graduate or end your studies. This is usually the end of April for most students when they finish their Winter semester (Jan - Apr). So every summer during your studies if you are not taking any Spring/Summer courses, interest starts to accumulate, even if you are planning to return to school in the Fall. However, since you plan to return to school to continue your studies the <strong>interest is cleared</strong>. This is because the Spring/Summer term is only 4 months, which is less than the maximum grace period of 6 months, and your status is returned to In-Study in September. It is only if you do not decide to return to school to continue your studies in the fall, the interest will not be forgiven and added on to your outstanding loan. This is the case regardless of the specific term one is not in school. If you take the winter semester off (4 months), but return in the Spring/Summer as full time, they same rule applies to you. However, if you take the Winter semester and the Spring/Summer semester off (8 months) without being registered in an approved co-op and return in the fall, you will have accrued interest and would even need to begin paying off your loans after the 6 month mark.</p>
            
            <h3>Minimum Course Requirements</h3>
            <p>You must complete and pass 60% of your course load during your academic year otherwise you will be put on academic probation by osap. Which is essentially a warning for you to make sure you pass the required amount of courses in the following year. If you fail to pass 60% of the courses the following year as well then you will be put on academic restriction by osap which means no funding for you for one year. During that year you will have to pay out of pocket for your courses while making sure to pass the required amount of courses. If you succeed then you can apply to osap once again after you do the 1 year time. You will have to submit documentation as to why you did not perform as expected during both the years you failed to pass the required amount of courses.<br>It is also important not to put all your trust in the ability to get a long term internship so you can make enough money to pay off your loans. Make backup plans in case you are unable to find an internship.</p>

            <h3>Penalties</h3>
            <p>There are a few cases in which your grants, which you don’t have to pay back, are converted into loans.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>you withdraw from studies or stop taking the minimum course load within the first 30 days of starting school</li>
              <li>at the end of the study period, as a result of an OSAP reassessment, you’re not entitled to all or part of the grant that you received (e.g., dropped courses, unreported income)</li>
              <li>the income reported in connection to your application can’t be verified within one year from the start of your studies (Ontario Student Grant only)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Continuation of studies but not taking OSAP?</h3>            
            <p>If you’re continuing full time or part time studies, but don’t plan on applying for OSAP in the upcoming year and have an outstanding loan balance, you can apply for continuation of interest free status in order to not have any interest accrued on your previous loans. Simply apply for interest-free status on OSAP’s website.</p>

            <h3>Repayment Assistance</h3>
            <p>If you are at the end of your studies and you don’t have enough money to pay off your loans or do not want to extend your degree/ continue your education there may still be a way to avoid interest. The government can cover some or all interest depending on household size and gross income; also disabilities/special cases.</p>

            <!--Nasar insert table here-->

            <p><strong>Note:</strong>If you are out of highschool for 6* years then you are considered an independent student. This means osap will class you as your own family of one instead of being part of your larger household. You will also most likely receive more funding so it may be possible for you to pay off all your tuition with just grants.<br>*Prior to Sep 1 2019 independent student status was given 4 years after highschool.</p>

            <p>After 5 years (60 months) on assistance you’ll enter repayment stage 2, in which the government pays some of the principle loan but you will not be eligible to take any more loans during that stage. Visit this link to see if you are eligible for repayment assistance and this to get an estimate.</p>

            <h3>Paying with points</h3>
            <p>If you have a lot of points from credit cards you can check this website to see how you can make payments using them.</p>
