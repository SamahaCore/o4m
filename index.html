          <!--<p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2014 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p>-->
          <p>The Ontario Student Assistant Program (OSAP) provides funds to students needing financial assistance for
            their post secondary education. The funding is made up of 3 parts: two of which are grants that do not need
            to be repaid and one of which is a loan that will need to be repaid at a later date. The grants include: The
            <strong>Ontario student grant</strong> and The <strong>Canada student grant for full time students</strong>,
            whereas the loan is composed of a <strong>Canada - Ontario integrated student loan</strong>.</p>
          <p>It is important to keep in mind that the loan portion is an integrated provincial and federal loan. They
            are two independent components of the loan, each with its own properties. Later we will discuss how
            different rules apply to both of them separately.</p>
          <p><strong>Grants</strong> are essentially free money provided by the government to reduce the overall loans
            on students. Students do not need to repay grants. <strong>Loans</strong> are NOT FREE money. All loans will
            need to be paid off at an eventual date.</p>
          <p><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> Use extra grants/ scholarships/ bursaries that are left over after educational
            expenses to pay off loans as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>During the life of a student, they are put within three categories depending on their current status.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The <strong><em>In-Study</em></strong> category is defined as when a student is currently in school
              pursuing education. In this stage, students <strong>are not required to make any payments and DO NOT
                accumulate any interest</strong> on outstanding loans, provided enrollment is confirmed every year.</li>
            <li>The <strong><em>Non-Repayment</em></strong> category is known as a “grace period” and occurs when the
              student is no longer within the <em>In-Study</em> period, lasting 6 months after <em>In-Study</em> status
              ends. In this stage, the student <strong>does not need to make any payments</strong> towards outstanding
              loans, but, they <strong>do begin to accumulate interest</strong> on those loans. More details of this
              phase are discussed below.</li>
            <li>The <strong><em>Repayment</em></strong> category is when the <em>Non-Repayment</em> stage ends, and
              students are mandated to begin paying off their loans.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><em>For more general information click <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/learn-about-osap"
                target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>

          <h4 id="second">Grace period: What is it?</h4>
          <p>The <strong>Grace period</strong> is a 6-month period that begins after you graduate or leave school.
            During this period, you are not required to start repaying your loan. However, what many students don’t
            realize is that during this period, <strong>interest starts to accumulate</strong><a
              href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/pay-back-osap" target="_blank"> (check "Pay back OSAP")</a>. Earlier, we
            mentioned to take note that the Ontario (provincial) and Canada (federal) components of the loans are
            separate, and this is why: during the grace period, interest is not charged <a
              href="https://www.csnpe-nslsc.canada.ca/en/glossary" target="_blank">(check "Non-repayment")</a> on the
            federal portion of your loan, but it is charged on the provinical portion.* After the 6-month grace period,
            interest will accumulate on both components of the loan.</p>
          <p>*<strong>Note:</strong> After the <a
              href="https://news.ontario.ca/maesd/en/2019/01/affordability-of-postsecondary-education-in-ontario.html"
              target="_blank">changes made by the provincial government</a>, interest will be charged on the provincial
            portion of the loan during the grace period instead of the federal portion. Prior to September 1, 2019
            interest would accrue on the federal portion but not the provincial portion. </p>

          <h4>Grace period: Forgiven Interest</h4>
          <p>Many students think of the grace period as the six-month interest-free period that begins after graduation.
            This is not entirely accurate. Post secondary students taking OSAP actually go through a grace period every
            year without even knowing about it. Each year, a grace period is initiated on the last day of the last OSAP-funded term. For most students, this is usually the end of April, when they finish their
            Winter semester. So, during summer break, if you are not taking any spring or summer courses, interest
            starts to accumulate (even if you are planning to return to school for the fall semester). However, when you
            actually return to school in September, the interest gets cleared. This is because the spring/summer term is
            only 4 months, which is less than the maximum grace period of 6 months. By returning to school in September,
            you return to the In-Study category. It is only if you do not decide to return to school for the fall
            semester that the interest will not be forgiven, and it will be added on to your outstanding loan. This is
            the case regardless of which term you are not in school. For example, if you take the winter semester off (4
            months) but return in the spring/summer semester as a full-time student, the same rule will apply to you.
            However, if you take the winter semester AND the spring/summer semester off (8 months) you will have accrued
            interest and will even be required to start repaying your loans after the 6-month mark. The only exception
            to the 6-month maximum is if you are registered in an approved co-op placement.</p>
          <p>In short, if you return to school as a full-time student within the grace period (6 months) the accrued
            interest will be forgiven.</p>

          <h4>Interest free status/switching to part-time studies</h4>
          <p>Once you take an OSAP loan for full-time studies, you are required to maintain full-time status or be
            registered in an approved internship in order to qualify for the interest-free status. In other words, as
            long as you remain in the “In-Study Category”, you will not have to make any payments and interest will not
            accrue. If at any time you wish to either switch into part-time studies (take less than 60% of the course
            load per term) or take a period of time off from school for longer than 6 months, <strong>interest will
              start to accumulate.</strong> If you haven't yet started your full-time studies you may consider starting off with a part-time OSAP loan to allow for more flexibility. Check the advices section below for more information. 
              <p>To learn more about continuation of interest free status click <a href="https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/A-ZListofAid/PRDR019241.html" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
              <strong>Note:</strong> Generally, most universities allow engineering
            students to go on a long-term internship (more than 4 months) while remaining eligible for continuation of
            interest-free status because they deem it a necessary part of the degree. Keep in mind that this is only
            applicable if you register and get your internship approved by your university. If you are not an
            engineering student, unless your specific program has allowed some sort of form or policy to get the
            interest free status, you will most likely not be able to continue your interest free status during an
            internship, even if your program name has “co-op” in it. Ask your financial aid advisor about being eligible
            for interest-free status before accepting any long-term internships.</p>

          <h4>Minimum Course Requirements</h4>
          <p>If you are taking an OSAP loan for full time studies, you must complete and pass 60% of your course load in
            <strong>each term</strong>* of your academic year. If you fail to do this, OSAP will place you on academic
            probation. This is essentially a warning for you to make sure that you pass the required number of courses
            in the following year. If you fail to pass 60% of the courses the following year as well then you will be
            put on academic restriction by OSAP. This means that you will not receive funding for one year. During that
            year you will have to pay out of pocket for your courses while making sure to pass the required number of
            courses. If you succeed then you can apply to OSAP once again for the following year. You will have to
            submit documentation explaining why you did not perform as expected during both the years you failed to pass
            the required number of courses.</p>
          <p>*<strong>Note:</strong> Course load percentages work differently in the spring/summer term. Be very careful
            when enrolling or dropping courses during that time, especially if you are unsure about your circumstances.
            In some cases, dropping even 1 course will switch your status from full-time to part-time. Be sure to
            consult your financial aid advisor before making any changes.</p>

          <h4>Penalties</h4>
          <p>There are a few <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/after-you-apply-osap" target="_blank">cases</a> in
            which your grants are converted into loans.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You withdraw from studies or stop taking the minimum course load within the first 30 days of starting
              school</li>
            <li>An OSAP reassessment is conducted, and it is determined that you were not entitled to all or part of the
              grant that you received (e.g., dropped courses, unreported income)</li>
            <li>The income you reported on your OSAP application cannot be verified within one year from the start of
              your studies. This only applies to your Ontario Student Grant.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Continuation of studies but not taking OSAP?</h4>
          <p>If you already have an outstanding OSAP loan and you plan to continue full-time or part-time studies
            without applying for an OSAP loan (i.e. you are paying for tuition out of pocket), you can still apply for
            continuation of interest-free status. This will prevent interest from accruing on your previous full-time
            loans. Simply apply for interest-free status on OSAP’s website. For more info click <a
              href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/after-you-apply-osap" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <h4>Repayment Assistance Plan</h4>
          <p>If you are at the end of your studies and you do not have enough money to pay off your loans or do not want
            to extend your degree/continue your education, there may still be a way to avoid interest. The government
            can cover some or all interest charges depending on household size and gross income. Disabilities and
            special cases are taken into consideration during this eligibility assessment. To learn more click <a

          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              <p>In theory, paying off debts is very simple. However, in reality, many people experience varying
                difficulties paying off their student loans. Just search current consumer and student debt numbers to
                see what we mean. Here are some practical advices that can help you better manage student debt:</p>

              <p>Don’t require an OSAP loan. What does this mean? Start saving early! For some, they are fortunate
                enough to have an education savings plan. By the time they reach post-secondary education, they have
                enough money saved up to pay for their education without requiring any external financial assistance. If
                you are in this group, consider yourself very fortunate and make the most of this blessing. Many of us,
                however, do not have an education savings plan that can fully or even partially cover our expenses.
                Fortunately, there are still things we can do to afford post secondary education without OSAP.</p>

              <h6><em><u>Precautionary Advice</u></em></h6>
              <p>You may choose to start off your post secondary education as a part-time student i.e. you are enrolled
                in 20-59% of your program’s full-time course load. As you read above, if you start off as a full-time
                student, it may feel like you're trapped in your post-secondary education since you can't take a long
                period of time off to work. So some students opt for part-time studies for various reasons such as being
                able to better manage their studies or so that they can have more time to work. All of the above
                mentioned policies will still apply to you, except there is one important difference: if you want to
                apply for continuation of interest-free status during your part-time studies, you will have to fill out
                the <a
                  href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/education/student-aid/grants-loans/information/forms.html"
                  target="_blank">schedule-2</a> form to confirm your enrolment in part-time studies.<br><br>Note:
                Interest will accrue on your account every month. However, it will be removed from your account at the
                end of each month as long as you are still enrolled in part-time studies. Call <a
                  href="https://protege-secure-2.csnpe-nslsc.canada.ca/eng/ContactUs.aspx" target="_blank">NSLSC</a> for
                more information.</p>

              <h6><em><u>Before post secondary education</u></em></h6>
              <h4>Start working and saving early!</h4>
              <p>Many teenagers pick up part time work during high-school. Make a decent resume and apply to your local
                businesses, ask your network of adults if they can help you get a job, and be creative. If you don’t
                like working a part-time job, start your own side-business after school and on the weekends. You can
                turn a hobby or interest of yours into money. If you don’t have any ideas, google side business ideas
                for teens. Pick something you’ll like and stick to it, whether it's a job or business, just start
                working! Make a budget to start saving a portion of your earnings towards your post-secondary education.
                Look into halal investment options where you can let your education fund grow over time.</p>

              <h4>Begin looking into scholarships</h4>
              <p>There are millions of dollars in unclaimed scholarships every year. Make a schedule where you can
                slowly, but consistently apply to as many scholarships as you can. Research online the best resources
                and techniques to help you with your applications. It’s going to be tough work, but the rewards are
                great! Imagine getting hundreds of dollars by only putting in 1 hour of work a day! Don’t be lazy like
                most people; take action!</p>

              <h6><em><u>During post secondary education</u></em></h6>
              <h4>Apply for OSAP Grants only</h4>
              <p>Did you know that you can apply for OSAP grants without taking any loans? Make sure to apply for the
                grant portion of OSAP. This is money provided by the government to fund your education, and it does not
                need to be paid back! Try to avoid taking the loan if you can.</p>

              <h4>Keep applying to scholarships</h4>
              <p>Many students stop applying once they get accepted and end up missing out on potentially thousands of
                dollars in financial assistance. Apply for bursaries and other grants. Research what grants and
                bursaries your school offers. Always apply! The worst case scenario is that you will not receive grants,
                but you will have spent some time practicing application skills (which will help when applying for jobs,
                schools, grants later on in life), and the best case is that you will get a lot of money to pay for your
                education. Remember to make a consistent application schedule. Dedicating just 1 hour everyday can
                really go a long way!</p>

              <h4>Work part-time during school and in the summers</h4>
              <p>This may not be a viable option for everyone, especially if you have a heavy course load. However, many
                students do manage to pull this off and scrape in some extra-income to help pay off their expenses. Many
                schools have work-study programs where they offer jobs on and around campus for students looking to work
                while they study. Make sure to make the most of your summers. Start applying to summer jobs a few months
                before the spring/summer semester begins. Not only does this make you money, but also gives you valuable
                experience to get a head-start on your career after graduation.</p>

              <h4>Do Co-op!</h4>
              <p>If you are in a registered Co-op program, make use of your school’s job board and research company
                websites to find summer postings. Co-op jobs traditionally pay higher than regular summer jobs and
                usually provide you with valuable experience related to your field. Take a year off for an approved
                internship. If you are in a registered Co-op program, apply for a 12-16 month internship or dedicate a
                whole year for 3-4 different 4 month Co-ops (this gives you more diversified experience). This step is
                highly recommended, especially if you are in a professional degree (engineering, business etc.). You can
                make a good sum of money to pay off your expenses and enter into your career after graduation with a
                year of professional experience, giving you a great advantage over your peers.</p>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important not to put all your trust in the ability to get a long term
                internship. Make backup plans in case you are unable to find an internship.</p>

              <h6><em><u>At the end of post secondary education and beyond</u></em></h6>
              <p>Congratulations on successfully completing your formal education! If you have made it this far without
                taking any loans, you are indeed very successful today, and have an incredible head start in life.</p>
              <p>If you required OSAP loans to pay your tuition and other fees, you should arrange to pay it all off
                before or while finishing up your final exams to avoid any interest charges. Remember that the term
                finishes at the end of the month; be diligent so as not to pay a single day’s worth of interest. This
                will only be possible if you took the necessary steps to work hard before and during University to make
                enough money to pay off your loan. If you manage to pay off your OSAP loan before finishing your finals
                with your own hard-earned money, congratulations, you are also ahead of the game.</p>
              <p>If you are unable to fully pay off your loan by the end of your exams, you still may have some hope.
                Try to get interest-free loans to pay off the OSAP loan. Make a solid career and repayment plan and take
                it to any family/friends that may be willing to loan you cash. You can ask multiple people to help with
                small amounts. Make sure to provide a concrete plan and timeline to repay their loan. Hopefully, you can
                gather enough money to pay off all of your OSAP loan before graduation. Keep an accurate record of how
                much you owe people and when and where you returned some or all of their money. Remember that these are
                your closest relationships, and wrongdoings involving money can jeopardize or irreparably harm your
                relationships. So do everything in your power to pay these loans off as soon as possible. Do not go and
                buy an expensive car with your first check if you still owe people money! Debts and the preservation of
                your ties of kinship should be your first priority as soon as your start making money. If friends/family
                is not an option for you, look into organizations that provide interest free loans (<a
                  href="https://beneficent.cc/" target="_blank">Beneficent</a>).</p>
              <p>If you are absolutely unable to gather enough funds to pay off your OSAP loan, you have no choice but
                to go through the traditional method of paying it off yourself over time while accruing interest. Your
                first priority should be paying off this student loan as soon as possible. This means finding any source
                of halal-income right away, even if it’s not your dream job. A budget should be made to put as much of
                your income as possible towards paying off the loan. The earlier you pay off the loan, the less interest
                you need to pay. It will be very difficult, but you will be very happy you did it when you’re debt free.
                If we find ourselves in this situation, we should repent for indulging in the paying of interest and
                make a sincere intention to never put ourselves in such an interest-bearing situation again. Indeed,
                Allah is the most merciful, so ask for His forgiveness and protection from dealing with interest. </p>
              <p>Note: If you were unable to find any interest free loan options then there are other avenues to get
                loans at a much lower interest rates. Use the lower interest rate loan to pay off your student debts to
                potentially save money.</p>

          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>I just finished my 2nd year in a business program. I am not taking any summer courses, and I
                  received an offer for a 4 month co-op in the fall term (Sept-Dec) of the upcoming year. Will I still
                  have interest free status?<br><br>Ans: Anytime you take a break from school, a grace period is
                  initiated. The maximum duration of the grace period is 6 months. If you return to full-time studies
                  during the grace period, all interest charges that have accrued during your break will be removed. In
                  this case, because your grace period starts at the beginning of May and finishes at the end of
                  December (a total of 8 months) the interest charges will remain on your account. There are three
                  possible solutions for avoiding interest in this case: (1) you enrol in full-time studies during the
                  summer term or (2) try to somehow take a 60% course load during your co-op term or (3) you decline the
                  coop position, and resume your full-time studies in September.<br><br>Note: after the 6 month period
                  you will also start to receive calls asking you to start repayment.</li><br>
                <li>I am in an engineering program, and I want to do an extra 8-month co-op starting in the winter term.
                  However, I do not want to inform my university because I will have to pay the co-op fee. Would my OSAP
                  loans still be interest free?<br><br>Ans: If you do not inform your university then they cannot inform
                  the financial aid office who in turn will not be able to confirm that you are still a student for OSAP
                  purposes. Hence, according to OSAP, your status will either be that you left school or that you
                  graduated. Unless you decide to somehow become a full-time student again within 6 months (take a 60%
                  course load in the May-Aug summer term), you will accrue interest and will be asked to make payments 6
                  months into your coop. Since you are in an engineering program, you may be eligible for continuation
                  of interest free status during coop depending on your university. If that is the case, we strongly
                  recommend paying the extra coop fee because it will protect you from accruing interest charges.</li>
