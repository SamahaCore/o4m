**Re: OSAP query**

**Answer:**  
From the outset, it should be understood that the payment of interest is undoubtedly impermissible in Islām. The basis of this prohibition are explicit textual evidences from the Qur’ān and Sunnah. Consider the following verses of the Qur’an and hadith:

>“Allāh had made business lawful and interest unlawful." (Surah al Baqara: 275)

>Jābir (may Allāh be pleased with him) said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ cursed the acceptor of interest, its payer, the one who records, and even two witnesses. And the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would say that they are all equal.” (Muslim)

As such, it would only be permissible for a person to take a student loan if they would not be required to pay interest. However, if interest is stipulated in the loan contract but does not begin to accrue for a certain period of time (i.e. there is a grace period before the interest charges begin), it would only be permissible to take such a loan provided one is absolutely confident that he/she will be able to pay it off on time to ensure that no interest will be paid. If one is doubtful in regards to their ability to pay off the loan before interest accrues, one must abstain from taking such a loan.

With the above details in mind, the answers to your queries may be found below:

### Is OSAP permissible?
It is permissible to apply for OSAP or other financial aid programs to help students with their student loans.

### Do OSAP students have to pay zakah?
When calculating the amount of zakāh one owes, a person should deduct any debts from their zakatable assets. Thereafter, if the remaining amount is equivalent to nisāb (i.e. the value of 612.36 grams of silver), one would pay 2.5% of that amount in zakāh. In regards to long-term debts (debts which are to be paid off over a certain number of years) such as student loans, the entire loan would only be deducted in the case where one is actively trying to pay off the debt. Otherwise, one should only deduct the amount of the loan they intend to pay the upcoming year.

### Do OSAP students have to perform udhiya/qurbani?
Udḥiya is binding on sane and mature individuals (who are not travellers on the days of ‘Eīd) whose total assets (after deducting debts) are equivalent to or exceed the quantum of nisāb. The details regarding the deduction of long-term debts such as student loans are the same as mentioned above.

### Can OSAP students go to hajj/umrah? (Includes note on sadaqat-ul-fitr)
Long-term debts, such as student loans, will be deducted when calculating one’s assets if one is actively trying to pay off their loan. However, if one is not actively trying to pay off their loan and is rather doing so in fixed installments, they should only deduct the amount of the loan they intend to pay off the following year. The same principle would be applied when calculating one’s assets to determine if they are liable for zakāh, sadaqa al-fitr, udḥiya, or Haj.

And Allah knows best.

### Can OSAP students receive zakah?

By the grace of Almighty God, here in Canada, Muslims discharge their charity, zakāh, ṣadaqat al fiṭr and donations to local mosques in many cases. The Muslim community deputes the managements of mosques as their representatives for these amounts to be discharged and the obligation to be fulfilled on their behalf. The community trusts these responsible personnel of mosques to ensure that the rightful recipients receive the funds. For many years now, mosque managements have been fulfilling this responsibility. May the Almighty grant them a tremendous reward. Āmīn.

In regards to this, few requests are hereby presented:

Muslims are arriving from various regions and countries of the world to reside here. They are making this country their homeland. For this very reason, they are establishing homes, businesses, Islamic institutions, mosques, schools and other Muslim organizations. Along side this; they are also concerned for the religious and secular education, upbringing, progress and prosperity of their children and offspring.

Looking at the conditions, we are all aware of the environment of public schools and universities here. How many of our teen boys and girls have we lost? The parents of these youth continue to remain in the agony of remorse and sorrow.

The desire of many Muslim parents is to admit their children in Islamic schools but because they are unable to afford tuition fees, they do not. They incur debts and life becomes tense.

We also would all like our Muslim male and female students to achieve the highest standards in religious and secular education. Thus, attaining degrees and thereafter serving the Muslim communities and the broader society as well. In our country, there is a need for top religious scholars, ʿulamā, ālimahs, and muftis. Likewise, there is a dire need of highly talented school teachers, doctors, lawyers, dentists and journalists etc.

When parents and talented male and female students have the desire and yet due to lack of resources i.e. they do not have appropriate financial status, are unable to proceed further [for enrollment].

Keeping this preamble in mind some matters are to be considered and can be adopted:

We need to protect our children from bad environment which are rampant in many public schools.
The Muslim community requires high degree holding teachers for Islamic schools. Likewise, to fulfill the need of the community, there is a need of talented Muslim professionals in various fields.
The Muslim community requires expert professional religious scholars, ʿulamā, ālimahs, and muftis.
There are many muslim families who are unable to afford fees. They become victims of debt.
Mature (bāligh) youth, boys and girls, due to tuition fees being unbearable, incur debts owing large amounts to the government or other financial institutes. Thus, they become valid recipients of zakāh.
Keeping the above mentioned details in mind, we the undersigned, in light of the Noble Qurʿān, Ḥadīth and Fiqh (jurisprudence) make a humble request; that a considerable portion of these funds should be distributed to local Muslim students (boys & girls) for their religious and secular education. They are genuine recipients of the funds. In this manner, our Islamic schools will also be strengthened and a large number of Muslim students will become educated professionals. They will also maintain a relation with the supportive Islamic organizations. The Prophet (peace and blessings upon him) has stated in relation to zakāh:

> “It (zakāh) should be taken from their wealthy and returned to their needy.” (Ḥadīth)

Many a times, the foreign institutions where we send the gathered funds, are not in as much a need, in comparison to the local needs.

In order to bring these requests into practice, rules and guidelines can be established by the organizations. It is hoped that the mosque managements, keeping the importance of this in mind, will render attention in this matter.
