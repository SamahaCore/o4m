# <u>Important Policies and Definitions</u>

The Ontario Student Assistant Program (OSAP) provides funds to students needing financial assistance for their post secondary education. The funding is made up of 3 parts: two of which are grants that do not need to be repaid and one of which is a loan that will need to be repaid at a later date. The grants include: The **Ontario student grant** and The **Canada student grant for full time students**, whereas the loan is composed of a **Canada - Ontario integrated student loan**.

It is important to keep in mind that the loan portion is an integrated provincial and federal loan. They are two independent components of the loan, each with its own properties. Later we will discuss how different rules apply to both of them separately.

**Grants** are essentially free money provided by the government to reduce the overall loans on students. Students do not need to repay grants. **Loans** are NOT FREE money. All loans will need to be paid off at an eventual date.

**Pro-Tip:** Use extra grants/ scholarships/ bursaries that are left over after educational expenses to pay off loans as soon as possible.

During the life of a student, they are put within three categories depending on their current status.

1.  The **_In-Study_** category is defined as when a student is currently in school pursuing education. In this stage, students **are not required to make any payments and DO NOT accumulate any interest** on outstanding loans, provided enrollment is confirmed every year.
2.  The **_Non-Repayment_** category is known as a “grace period” and occurs when the student is no longer within the _In-Study_ period, lasting 6 months after _In-Study_ status ends. In this stage, the student **does not need to make any payments** towards outstanding loans, but, they **do begin to accumulate interest** on those loans. More details of this phase are discussed below.
3.  The **_Repayment_** category is when the _Non-Repayment_ stage ends, and students are mandated to begin paying off their loans.

## Grace period: What is it?

The **Grace period** is a 6-month period that begins after you graduate or leave school. During this period, you are not required to start repaying your loan. However, what many students don’t realize is that during this period, **interest starts to accumulate** [(check "Pay back OSAP")](https://www.ontario.ca/page/pay-back-osap). Earlier, we mentioned to take note that the Ontario (provincial) and Canada (federal) components of the loans are separate, and this is why: during the grace period, interest is not charged [(check "Non-repayment")](https://www.csnpe-nslsc.canada.ca/en/glossary) on the federal portion of your loan, but it is charged on the provinical portion.\* After the 6-month grace period, interest will accumulate on both components of the loan.

**\*Note:** After the [changes made by the provincial government](https://news.ontario.ca/maesd/en/2019/01/affordability-of-postsecondary-education-in-ontario.html), interest will be charged on the provincial portion of the loan during the grace period instead of the federal portion. Prior to September 1, 2019 interest would accrue on the federal portion but not the provincial portion.

## Grace period: Forgiven Interest

Many students think of the grace period as the six-month interest-free period that begins after graduation. This is not entirely accurate. Post secondary students taking OSAP actually go through a grace period every year without even knowing about it. Each year, a grace period is initiated on the last day of the last OSAP-funded term. For most students, this is usually the end of April, when they finish their Winter semester. So, during summer break, if you are not taking any spring or summer courses, interest starts to accumulate (even if you are planning to return to school for the fall semester). However, when you actually return to school in September, the interest gets cleared. This is because the spring/summer term is only 4 months, which is less than the maximum grace period of 6 months. By returning to school in September, you return to the In-Study category. It is only if you do not decide to return to school for the fall semester that the interest will not be forgiven, and it will be added on to your outstanding loan. This is the case regardless of which term you are not in school. For example, if you take the winter semester off (4 months) but return in the spring/summer semester as a full-time student, the same rule will apply to you. However, if you take the winter semester AND the spring/summer semester off (8 months) you will have accrued interest and will even be required to start repaying your loans after the 6-month mark. The only exception to the 6-month maximum is if you are registered in an approved co-op placement.

In short, if you return to school as a full-time student within the grace period (6 months) the accrued interest will be forgiven.

## Interest free status/switching to part-time studies

Once you take an OSAP loan for full-time studies, you are required to maintain full-time status or be registered in an approved internship in order to qualify for the interest-free status. In other words, as long as you remain in the “In-Study Category”, you will not have to make any payments and interest will not accrue. If at any time you wish to either switch into part-time studies (take less than 60% of the course load per term) or take a period of time off from school for longer than 6 months, **interest will start to accumulate.** If you haven't yet started your full-time studies you may consider starting off with a part-time OSAP loan to allow for more flexibility. Check the advices section below for more information.

**Note:** Generally, most universities allow engineering students to go on a long-term internship (more than 4 months) while remaining eligible for continuation of interest-free status because they deem it a necessary part of the degree. Keep in mind that this is only applicable if you register and get your internship approved by your university. If you are not an engineering student, unless your specific program has allowed some sort of form or policy to get the interest free status, you will most likely not be able to continue your interest free status during an internship, even if your program name has “co-op” in it. Ask your financial aid advisor about being eligible for interest-free status before accepting any long-term internships.

## Minimum Course Requirements

If you are taking an OSAP loan for full time studies, you must complete and pass 60% of your course load in **each term\*** of your academic year. If you fail to do this, OSAP will place you on academic probation. This is essentially a warning for you to make sure that you pass the required number of courses in the following year. If you fail to pass 60% of the courses the following year as well then you will be put on academic restriction by OSAP. This means that you will not receive funding for one year. During that year you will have to pay out of pocket for your courses while making sure to pass the required number of courses. If you succeed then you can apply to OSAP once again for the following year. You will have to submit documentation explaining why you did not perform as expected during both the years you failed to pass the required number of courses.

**\*Note:** Course load percentages work differently in the spring/summer term. Be very careful when enrolling or dropping courses during that time, especially if you are unsure about your circumstances. In some cases, dropping even 1 course will switch your status from full-time to part-time. Be sure to consult your financial aid advisor before making any changes.

## Penalties

There are a few [cases](https://www.ontario.ca/page/after-you-apply-osap) in which your grants are converted into loans.

- You withdraw from studies or stop taking the minimum course load within the first 30 days of starting school
- An OSAP reassessment is conducted, and it is determined that you were not entitled to all or part of the grant that you received (e.g., dropped courses, unreported income)
- The income you reported on your OSAP application cannot be verified within one year from the start of your studies. This only applies to your Ontario Student Grant.

## Continuation of studies but not taking OSAP?

If you already have an outstanding OSAP loan and you plan to continue full-time or part-time studies without applying for an OSAP loan (i.e. you are paying for tuition out of pocket), you can still apply for continuation of interest-free status. This will prevent interest from accruing on your previous full-time loans. Simply apply for interest-free status on OSAP’s website.

## Repayment Assistance Plan

If you are at the end of your studies and you do not have enough money to pay off your loans or do not want to extend your degree/continue your education, there may still be a way to avoid interest. The government can cover some or all interest charges depending on household size and gross income. Disabilities and special cases are taken into consideration during this eligibility assessment.
