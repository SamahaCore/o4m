The Ontario Student Assistant Program (OSAP) provides funds to students needing financial assistance for their post secondary education. The funding is made up of three parts, two of which are grants and one of which is a loan.

**Grants** are essentially free money provided by the government to reduce the overall loans on students. Students do not need to repay grants. The grants include the **Ontario student grant** and the **Canada student grant for full time students**.

**Loans** are NOT FREE money. All loans will need to be paid off at an eventual date. The loan is composed of a **Canada - Ontario integrated student loan**.

It is important to keep in mind that the loan portion of funding is an integrated _provincial_ and _federal_ loan. They are two independent components of the loan, each with its own properties. Later, we will discuss how different rules apply to both of them, separately.

_Pro-Tip: Use extra grants/scholarships/bursaries that are left over after educational expenses to pay off loans as soon as possible._

A student always has one of the three following statuses:

1.  **In-Study**: when a student is currently enrolled at a post-secondary institution. Students are **not required to make any payments and DO NOT accumulate any interest** on outstanding loans, provided enrollment is confirmed every year.
2.  **Non-Repayment**: a period lasting 6 months after _In-Study_ status ends. The student is **not expected to make any payments, but DO accumulate interest** on outstanding loans. More details are discussed below. Also known as a “grace period”.
3.  **Repayment**: when the _Non-Repayment_ stage ends, and a student is **expected to pay off outstanding loans**.

## Grace period: What is it?

A **Grace period** is a 6-month period that begins after you graduate or leave school. During this period, you are not expected to start repaying your loan. However, what many students don’t realize is that during this period, **interest starts to accumulate** [(check "Pay back OSAP")](https://www.ontario.ca/page/pay-back-osap). Earlier, we mentioned to take note that the Ontario (provincial) and Canada (federal) components of the loans are separate, and this is why: during the grace period, interest is not charged [(check "Non-repayment")](https://www.csnpe-nslsc.canada.ca/en/glossary) on the federal portion of your loan, but it is charged on the provincial portion.\* After the 6-month grace period, interest will accumulate on both components of the loan.

**\*Note:** After the [changes made by the provincial government](https://news.ontario.ca/maesd/en/2019/01/affordability-of-postsecondary-education-in-ontario.html), interest will be charged on the provincial portion of the loan during the grace period instead of the federal portion. Prior to September 1, 2019 interest would accrue on the federal portion but not the provincial portion.

## Grace period: Forgiven Interest

[comment]: <> (Text goes from third person to second. "You" should be avoided. Either re-work second person, or revise.)
If a student returns to school as a full-time student within the grace period (6 months) the accrued interest will be forgiven.
[comment]: <> (Consider revising second person)
Many students think of the grace period as the six-month interest-free period that begins after graduation. This is not entirely accurate. Post secondary students taking OSAP actually go through a grace period every year without even knowing about it. Each year, a grace period is initiated on the last day of the last OSAP-funded term. For most students, this is usually the end of April, when they finish their Winter semester. So, during summer break, if you are not taking any spring or summer courses, interest starts to accumulate (even if you are planning to return to school for the fall semester). However, when you actually return to school in September, the interest gets cleared. This is because the spring/summer term is only 4 months, which is less than the maximum grace period of 6 months.
[comment]: <> (Consider revising second person)
By returning to school in September, you return to the In-Study category. It is only if you do not decide to return to school for the fall semester that the interest will not be forgiven, and it will be added on to your outstanding loan. This is the case regardless of which term you are not in school. For example, if you take the winter semester off (4 months) but return in the spring/summer semester as a full-time student, the same rule will apply to you. However, if you take the winter semester AND the spring/summer semester off (8 months) you will have accrued interest and will even be required to start repaying your loans after the 6-month mark. The only exception to the 6-month maximum is if you are registered in an approved co-op placement.

## Grace period: Extensions

There are 2 ways to extend the grace period from 6 months to 1 year:
1. Work in the Not-For-Profit sector
2. Start a business

**Note:** You must apply within the first grace period (6 months)

**Note:** From the links below, we understood that this extension only applies to the Ontario portion of the Canada-Ontario Integrated Student loan. Which means you may have to start making payments for the Canada portion of the loan and interest would start accruing for both portions after the initial 6 months.

### Extension for Not-For-Profit Employees

To be considered, you must meet the following criteria:
- You left full-time postsecondary studies within the last six months.
- You have full-time OSAP loans not currently in repayment status.
- You are working in Ontario at least 30 hours per week (as a paid and/or volunteer worker) at an eligible not-for-profit organization.

Eligible not-for-profit organizations are entities registered with the Canada Revenue Agency. They must be registered as a charity and/or incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation or similar entity with Canada, Ontario or another Canadian province or territory.

The following organizations, which may fall within the above definition, are excluded for the purposes of this program:

- Schools (public and private elementary, secondary, and postsecondary)
- Hospitals (public and private)
- Federal, provincial and municipal governments and their agencies
However, if you work at one of the excluded organizations and the work you do mainly or entirely involves administering their charitable activities (e.g., you raise funds or distribute raised funds for the charity or foundation of the organization), you can still apply for this program.

### Extension for Entrepreneurs

To be considered, you must meet the following criteria:

- You left full-time postsecondary studies within the last six months.
- You have full-time OSAP loans not currently in repayment status.
- You are the sole owner or joint owner of an eligible new business operating in Ontario.
- You are currently working in Ontario at least 30 hours per week for your eligible new business*.
Sole owner or joint owner includes a director or officer of the business with a controlling share.

*Eligible new business means:

- a business that has been registered with the CRA within the current calendar year or within the two previous calendar years; or
- a business registered with the CRA in which you acquired a controlling interest within the current calendar year or within the two previous calendar years.

## Interest free status/switching to part-time studies

Once you take an OSAP loan for full-time studies, you are required to maintain full-time status or be registered in an approved internship in order to qualify for the interest-free status. In other words, as long as you remain in the “In-Study Category”, you will not have to make any payments and interest will not accrue. If at any time you wish to either switch into part-time studies (take less than 60% of the course load per term) or take a period of time off from school for longer than 6 months, **interest will start to accumulate.** If you haven't yet started your full-time studies you may consider starting off with a part-time OSAP loan to allow for more flexibility. Check the advices section for more information.

To learn more about continuation of interest free status click [here.](https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/A-ZListofAid/PRDR019241.html)

**Note:** Generally, most universities allow engineering students to go on a long-term internship (more than 4 months) while remaining eligible for continuation of interest-free status because they deem it a necessary part of the degree. Keep in mind that this is only applicable if you register and get your internship approved by your university. If you are not an engineering student, unless your specific program has allowed some sort of form or policy to get the interest free status, you will most likely not be able to continue your interest free status during an internship, even if your program name has “co-op” in it. Ask your financial aid advisor about being eligible for interest-free status before accepting any long-term internships.

## Minimum Course Requirements

If you are taking an OSAP loan for full time studies, you must complete and pass 60% of your course load in **each term\*** of your academic year. If you fail to do this, OSAP will place you on academic probation. This is essentially a warning for you to make sure that you pass the required number of courses in the following year. If you fail to pass 60% of the courses the following year as well then you will be put on academic restriction by OSAP. This means that you will not receive funding for one year. During that year you will have to pay out of pocket for your courses while making sure to pass the required number of courses. If you succeed then you can apply to OSAP once again for the following year. You will have to submit documentation explaining why you did not perform as expected during both the years you failed to pass the required number of courses.

**Academic year:**
For OSAP the academic year runs from August 1 to July 31 of the following year.

**\*Note:** Course load percentages work differently in the spring/summer term. Be very careful when enrolling or dropping courses during that time, especially if you are unsure about your circumstances. In some cases, dropping even 1 course will switch your status from full-time to part-time. Be sure to consult your financial aid advisor before making any changes.

## Penalties

There are a few [cases](https://www.ontario.ca/page/after-you-apply-osap) in which your grants are converted into loans.

- You withdraw from studies or stop taking the minimum course load within the first 30 days of starting school
- An OSAP reassessment is conducted, and it is determined that you were not entitled to all or part of the grant that you received (e.g., dropped courses, unreported income)
- The income you reported on your OSAP application cannot be verified within one year from the start of your studies. This only applies to your Ontario Student Grant.

## Continuation of studies but not taking OSAP?

If you already have an outstanding OSAP loan and you plan to continue full-time or part-time studies without applying for an OSAP loan (i.e. you are paying for tuition out of pocket), you can still apply for continuation of interest-free status. This will prevent interest from accruing on your previous full-time loans. Simply apply for interest-free status on OSAP’s website.

**Note:** When you enroll into full-time studies it does not have to be a public postsecondary school in Ontario, you can check this [list](https://osap.gov.on.ca/SchoolSearchWeb/search/school_search.xhtml?lang=en) for other approved schools. If the school is not on the list you can submit this [form](https://osap.gov.on.ca/prodconsumption/groups/forms/documents/forms/tcont003568.pdf) to apply for interest-free status consideration.

- To be considered for interest-free status, your study period must be between 6 and 52 weeks long.
- All aspects of your study period, including co-op work terms and work placements, can be included for interest-free status consideration provided your program is:
    - approved for full-time OSAP purposes and leads to a degree, diploma or certificate; or
    - academic upgrading at a public college or university in Ontario (e.g., high school equivalency programs, English or French as a second language, pre-university programs); or
    - a pre-requisite program for admission into either a university graduate studies program or a second entry level degree program.

## OSAP Lifetime limit

There is a lifetime limit of 340 weeks for student loan funding. This converts to about 19 terms which OSAP will fund.

**Note:** For students in doctoral programs the limit is 400 weeks and students with disabilities are granted 520 weeks.

## Repayment Assistance Plan

If you are at the end of your studies and you do not have enough money to pay off your loans or do not want to extend your degree/continue your education, there may still be a way to avoid interest. The government can cover some or all interest charges depending on household size and gross income. Disabilities and special cases are taken into consideration during this eligibility assessment.

### Monthly Gross Family Income Thresholds for Zero Payment under RAP by Family Size

| Family Size | Income Threshold |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| 1           | \$2,083          |
| 2           | \$3,254          |
| 3           | \$4,205          |
| 4           | \$4,959          |
| 5+          | \$5,652          |

**Note:** Household income includes the loan holder's income and a spouse's income (if applicable). It does not include the loan holder's parents' or siblings' income. Family size includes the loan holder, spouse and dependants (children under 21) living at the same address. The definition of "income" can be found [here](https://www.csnpe-nslsc.canada.ca/en/glossary). (check "Income")
